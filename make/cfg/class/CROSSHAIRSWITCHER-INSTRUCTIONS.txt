________________
- INSTALLATION -
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
To install the Crosshair Switcher, extract the cfg folder to:

Program Files\Steam\steamapps\<user name>\team fortress 2\tf\

REMEMBER TO BACK UP YOUR CLASS CFG'S BEFORE INSTALLING THE CROSSHAIR
SWITCHER, IF YOU HAVE ANY CLASS-SPECIFIC SCRIPTS IN THERE!
_____________________________
- CUSTOMIZE YOUR CROSSHAIRS -
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
open cfg/crosshairswitcher/settings.cfg and edit the aliases
there which are following this syntax:

<class>_<slot> "size; color; type; viewmodel FOV or viewmodel off"

to your liking.

At the top, there are 3 presets you can change and use instead of "size; ...".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To disable crosshair-switching for a class, simply change this in the class cfg file:

exec crosshairswitcher/switcher -> exec crosshairswitcher/disable

When disabling the switcher, the crosshair that you specified for the primary slot
of this class will be used.

Per default, the switcher is disabled for Heavy, Engie and Spy to prevent minor,
unavoidable glitches.
________________________
- CUSTOMIZE YOUR BINDS -
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
open cfg/crosshairswitcher/binds.cfg and change the binds for the functions
listed there to your liking.

Quickswitch is bound to ALT per default, change ALT to the key you normally
use, else you can't switch slots with 1, 2 & 3 when using the quickswitch menu!

I've already made a section under the default binds which sets the script to
select slot1 on mousewheel UP, slot2 on mousewheel DOWN and slot3 with the
upper thumbbutton.

To use this alternate bind-config, simply uncomment the whole section and leave
the upper one - it will then overwrite the default settings.

If you want the lastweapon command to only switch between your primary and
secondary weapon, uncomment the last section and change q to something else
if you prefer a different key.
________________________________
- INTEGRATION OF OTHER SCRIPTS -
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
If you have any other scripts, insert them into the class cfg files
from your backup. Note that to work correctly, they will now require
weapon1 instead of slot1 and so on - otherwise your scripts will only
change the slot and not the crosshair.

To do this, simply do "search and replace" in your text editor and
let it replace all instances of "slot" with "weapon".

You don't have to do this for classes where you disabled the crosshair switcher.
